# Working with images on the site

Getting your images ready for use on the site is a matter of authoring them at the correct resolution (i.e. width x height), and saving them out at the proper filesize.

## __Featured Image Size - 1920x475px__

The top title area of each page or blog post can display a large full-width feature image. In your graphics software, author these images at `1920x475px`.

## __Tips on Saving Your Images for the Web__

You want to *try* to keep your Featured Image filesizes at or below 100Kb. This way your images will load quickly on slow connections. Here are some tips on how to do that:

### 1. Use the correct compression scheme (i.e. JPG or GIF/PNG)

If your image is a photograph, save it as a JPEG/JPG. The JPEG file format is made to handle photographic images. On the other hand, if your graphic has few colors and looks more like "line art", save it as a GIF or PNG.

When you're saving out your image, your software should give you a filesize estimate, so experiement with the different compression schemes (i.e. JPG, GIF, or PNG) to see which one provides the best combination of a small filesize and acceptible image quality.

### 2. Add a blur

Adding a blur filter to your images will reduce their filesize when saving out photographs as JPGs. This works great with the Featured Images displayed at the top of pages since you don't want the detail in your image to compete with the page title overlaid on top of it.
